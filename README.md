# Sentiment-Analysis-with-NLTK-s-VADER-and-Huggingface-Roberta-Transformers

## Project Description
The sentiment analysis classifier in this project is trained to predict the sentiment of customer reviews on Amazon. The reviews are classified into positive, negative, or neutral. The project uses two different packages for the sentiment analysis: NLTK's VADER and Huggingface Roberta Transformers. The outputs of the two packages are compared and analyzed to understand the differences in the model outputs.

## Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.6 or later
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Transformers package from Huggingface
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Usage
The sentiment analysis classifier can be run by running the sentiment_analysis.py script in the terminal. The script loads the customer review data, preprocesses it, and trains the sentiment analysis classifier using NLTK's VADER and Huggingface Roberta Transformers. The script also generates a confusion matrix and a classification report to evaluate the performance of the model.

## Built With
